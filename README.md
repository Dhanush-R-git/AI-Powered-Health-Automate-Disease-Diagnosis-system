# AI-Powered Health [Automate Disease Diagnosis System]

This project aims to leverage machine learning models to predict the likelihood of various diseases based on user inputs. The diseases covered in this system include Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson's Disease.

## Diseases Covered

### 1. Diabetes
Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs when the pancreas is no longer able to make insulin, or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. This leads to elevated levels of glucose in the blood (hyperglycemia).

### 2. Heart Disease
Heart disease refers to various types of heart conditions, including coronary artery disease, heart attacks, and more. It is one of the leading causes of death globally.

### 3. Parkinson's Disease
Parkinson’s disease is a progressive nervous system disorder that affects movement. It is associated with tremors, stiffness, and slow movement.

## Usage

To use this system, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the application using `streamlit run app.py`.
4. Navigate to the web interface and input the required parameters for each disease prediction.

## Models

The models used in this system are trained using various machine learning algorithms and are saved in the `model_saved` directory. The models include:

- `diabetes_model.pkl`
- `heart_model.pkl`
- `parkinson_model.pkl`
